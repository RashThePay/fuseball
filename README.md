## 🚀 How to build

Make sure you have [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) installed (`npx` is shipped by default since npm `5.2.0`).

Then, just run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/theneuetimes/fuseball.git
npm install
npm run start
```

Navigate to your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` - you should see the game running there.
